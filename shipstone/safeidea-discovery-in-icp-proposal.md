# SafeIdea v3 Platform to Integrate ICRC3/ICRC7/ICRC99 with vetKeys

## Project Overview

SafeIdea v3 integrates ICRC3, ICRC7, and ICRC99 token standards with vetKeys on ICP. This open-source platform lets developers build apps where users can encrypt and share digital assets with controlled access. SafeIdea enables use cases such as IP management, digital media monetization, and encrypted business processes including trade secrets. By combining standard token interfaces with vetKeys encryption, developers can add privacy features to their ICP projects without building encryption infrastructure from scratch.

## Technical Implementation Details

### vetKeys Integration
```motoko
type EncryptedAsset = {
  id: Nat;                    // NFT token ID
  title: Text;                // Asset title
  description: Text;          // Asset description  
  creatorPrincipal: Text;     // IC identity of creator
  submissionTime: Time;       // Unix timestamp
  assetHash: Text;            // SHA-256 of content
  encryptedData: Blob;        // vetKeys encrypted content
  accessList: [Principal];    // Authorized accessors
  category: Text;             // Asset category
  fileSize: Nat;              // Size in bytes
};
```

### Storage Strategy
- **Metadata**: ICRC7 standard token metadata
- **Encrypted Content**: vetKeys-encrypted stable memory storage
- **Access Control**: On-chain permission management
- **Large Files**: Chunked storage with reassembly on decryption
