The **VetKey Password Manager** is an example application demonstrating how to use **VetKeys** and **Encrypted Maps** to build a secure, decentralized password manager on the **Internet Computer (IC)**. This application allows users to create password vaults, store encrypted passwords, and share vaults with other users via their **Internet Identity Principal**.

## Features

- **Secure Password Storage**: Uses VetKey to encrypt passwords before storing them in Encrypted Maps.
- **Vault-Based Organization**: Users can create multiple vaults, each containing multiple passwords.
- **Access Control**: Vaults can be shared with other users via their **Internet Identity Principal**.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Local Internet Computer dev environment](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/dev-env)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install
```

### Deploy the Canisters

```bash
bash deploy_locally.sh
```

## Running the Project

### Backend

The backend consists of an **Encrypted Maps**-enabled canister that securely stores passwords. It is automatically deployed with `deploy_locally.sh`.

### Frontend

The frontend is a **Svelte** application providing a user-friendly interface for managing vaults and passwords.

To run the frontend in development mode with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```
